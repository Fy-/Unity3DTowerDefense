You can find the original video tutorial series on youtube, at [Tower Defence Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLH3mUGkfFCU0r9DkUKwRduWpcmpAzojc)

Here is the overview of all of N3K's work on youtube: [

The tutorial is pretty fun to follow and there have been regular updates.

I am not N3K, but did ask for his permission to post this here (and got it :) ).

What it is all about
----
This is the accompanying code to a Unity 3D tutorial (I am using Unity 5.3.1) on how to create a tower defense game with a first person view, as you can see on youtube.

I thought this may be helpful to others, so I upoaded it and made it public here.

The code and assets you will find
----
This version starts at video 2 and has a checkin for each video starting with video 6.

Each checkin is done after completing the vieo, so if you want to do video 7, you should revert to the checkin that says "video 6 camera motor".

The code and asset structure is very close to what is given in the video, only a few modification are done, like when I strongly disgree with the spelling :) or when something was not working (sometimes there are "bugfix" checkins bewteen the videos. Generally, what is presented in the end of the video is working with the next checkin.

During initial checkin, there are 38 videos out, and this repository covers all 38. I will usually update soon after release of new video, if you run into any problems, like missing files, or missing an update, just get in touch.

For this project, serialization to text is enabled in Unity, to improve versioning and diff.
